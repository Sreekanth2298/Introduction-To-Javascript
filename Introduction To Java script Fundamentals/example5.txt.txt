Comments in Java script :
-------------------------

. Generally we use comments for code explanation or purpose 

for example 


//i am collecting age of the user in currentAge variable      ==> single line comments
let currentAge = 24 ;

/*Here i am checking whether the user is major or not if the currentage of user is more than 18 years then consider him as major otherwise as minor */   ==> multi line comments

let isMajor = currentAge >18 ;


.Comments can be used to surpass certain lines without executing them , like i have written certain piece of code and it is not working so for now i will comment that particular code to test 
other things
'Comments can act as a remainder in future
