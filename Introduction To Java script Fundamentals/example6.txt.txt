For example 

let a =24 ;

let b = a>18 ;

If we look at the above example we are able to see only that certain operations are being done on variables , but we are not sure why we have created these variables and what is the significance of these operations .

let me reframe the same example 

let userCurrentAge =24;
let isUserMajor = userCurrentAge > 18 ;


from the above example we can conclude that above code is written to check whether current user is major or not my taking user's age as input . so it provides a functional meaning if we use
descriptive names to variables .
 It adds value to the code
