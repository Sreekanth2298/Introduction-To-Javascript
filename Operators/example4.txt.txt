It is similar to what we studied in our school like BODMAS in mathematics .

precedence and associativity ==>  which determine the order in which operations are performed when multiple operators are used in an expression.

Precedence: Precedence determines the order of evaluation when multiple operators are present in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

Associativity: Associativity determines the grouping of operands when multiple operators with the same precedence appear in an expression.

It is important to understand about precedence and associativity to avoid unexpected results while evaluating an expression .
